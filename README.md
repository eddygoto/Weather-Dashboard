# Weather-Dashboard

homework 6

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a weather dashboard! It should have a search bar for cities, and present the user with data pulled from OpenWeatherMap API. Already searched cities will save onto the webpage, allowing the user to re-search them with just the click of a button!

Unfortunately, I was unable to bugfix a TypeError. Data.list.dt is being read as undefined, and it causes the 5 day weather forecast to render incorrectly.

## Installation
